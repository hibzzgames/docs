The Deferred Runtime Operation Library (Dropl) provides users with a variety of tools and utilities to defer any operations such that they can be executed over time or at a later point in time.

## Installation
**Via Github**
This package can be installed in the Unity Package Manager using the following git URL.
```
https://github.com/hibzzgames/Hibzz.Dropl.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/hibzzgames/Hibzz.Dropl/releases) and manually import the package into your project.

## Usage
The Dropl library provides game developers with a variety of tools and utilities to defer any set of operations such that it can be executed over time or at a later point in time from the time of the request. This is useful for a variety of use cases such as UI animations, game logic, and more.

There are two main components to the library, the `Operation`, and the `Executer`. The abstract `Operation` class is used to define how a set of instructions need to be executed over time and the `Executer` is used to manage the execution of the defined operations.

For example, let's take this simple operation that moves a `Transform` from its current position to a target position over some time.

```csharp
// move the current transform to the position (0, 5, 0) over 5 seconds using a linear interpolation
// additionally, dropl provides a variety of other interpolation methods to work with
var moveOperation = new MoveOperation(transform, expectedPosition: new vector3(0, 5, 0), duration: 5f, easing: Interpolations.LINEAR);
```

The next step would be to add this operation to an `Executer`. The users can either create custom `Executer`s or use the default `Executer` provided by the library.

```csharp
// add the defined operation to the default executer
Executer.DefaultExecuter.Add(moveOperation);

// or alternatively, use the helper method AddToDefaultExecuter
moveOperation.AddToDefaultExecuter();
```

The library additionally provides a variety of core operations that can be used to create more complex operations. 
- **Sequence** - Executes a set of operations in a sequence
- **LambdaOperation** - Executes any instructions provided by the user without creating a new class
- **PropertyOperation** - Execute any property changes over a period of time
